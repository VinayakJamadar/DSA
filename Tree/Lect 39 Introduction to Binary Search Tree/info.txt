Condition for Binary Search Tree (BST)

1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
3. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Difference Between Binary Search Tree (BST) and Binary Tree (BT)

BST -> Average Time Complexity of CRUD Operation is O(log(n))
BT -> Average Time Complexity of CRUD Operation is O(n)
