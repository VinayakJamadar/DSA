Binary Tree: Tree having at max 2 childrens

Types of Binary Tree:
1. Perfect BT
2. Complete BT
3. Full BT
4. Balanced BT
5. Degenerate or Skew Tree

1. Perfect BT: 
all leaf nodes are at same level.

2. Complete BT: 
i. all levels are completely filled except the last level.
ii. the last level has all nodes in left as possible.

3. Full BT: 
all nodes has either 0 or 2 childrens.

4. Balanced BT:
height of tree at max log(n), where n = no. of nodes in tree
Or
absolute difference of heights of left and right subtrees at any node is less than or equal to 1

5. Degenerate(or Skew) Tree:
every node as only either 0 or 1 children.
